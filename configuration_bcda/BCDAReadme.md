# BCDA Connector 
The following is a collection of configurations that can use 
the FHIR connector to convert data in the 
[BCDA FHIR format](https://bcda.cms.gov/guide.html#fhir-types) to the 
[Tuva Claims Data Model](https://docs.tuvahealth.com/). 
*Note: Some additional staging is necessary to combine/separate the mapped data 
into the Tuva models Eligibility, Medical Claim, and Pharmacy Claim.*

To execute the script, run `py .\BCDAConnector.py` while in this folder.
